# Data science portfolio by Marcel Schneider

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Project overview

### Red Vinho Wine: What makes a good wine?

[Github](https://github.com/Marcel707/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/red_vinho_verde_wine_quality.ipynb)

Being one of the most common used datasets out there my goal is to utilize different prediction models and to explore the effectivness of the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) algorithm for combating the class imbalance between good and bad wine examples.
