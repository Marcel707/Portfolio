# Data science portfolio by Marcel Schneider

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms.

## Project overview

### Geospatial Analysis: Charging station coverage for electric cars in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania

[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Marcel707/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/electric_car_charging_station_coverage.ipynb) [Github](https://github.com/Marcel707/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/electric_car_charging_station_coverage.ipynb)

Motivation for this project is to examine the possibilities geospatial python packages offer. For that we want to display the areas, which have the best electric car charger stations coverage within the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

### Red Vinho Wine: What makes a good wine?

[Github](https://github.com/Marcel707/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/red_vinho_verde_wine_quality.ipynb)

Being one of the most common used datasets out there my goal is to utilize different prediction models and to explore the effectiveness of the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) algorithm for combating the class imbalance between good and bad wine entries.
